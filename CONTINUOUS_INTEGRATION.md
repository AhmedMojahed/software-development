# Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous integration (CI) is the process of methodical code merging and testing from multiple sources in an
effort to ensure that all code on a project works well with each other.
CI in practice is typically an automated process which checks newly proposed code from a developer
against existing code to ensure the changes do not break what is already in place.

The need for CI comes from multiple developers working on the same complex software project.
Developers cannot reasonably maintain complex software with multiple, interdependent features
by hand. A developer **could** be responsible for ensuring that every new bit of code, feature,
and bug fix does not introduce an error somewhere else in the code or otherwise break
the interdependency of the code, however, that is not saying they **should**. Doing
so would be a large waste of that developer's time and talent that could be better
spent on adding the new features or bug fixes. A better option would be to automate this
type of code checking in a way that minimizes both developer input, and developer time
while also introducing good coding habits.

We provide [several examples](#Examples-to-Help-Get-Started) if you want to try to get started right away.

## What should good CI look like?

Without going into specific CI options, we first consider what good general
rules a CI process should have:

1. Entirely automated process
1. Scheduled and Triggered actions
1. Visible status to all developers
1. Visible results to all developers
1. Logged outputs
1. Isolated build and testing environments

Let us cover each of these items in detail.

### Entirely Automated Process

CI processes should not involve developer input to execute and run. Once the
initial build is setup, CI should act in a way that does not require a
developer to manually queue up a check, and/or have to issue individual
 commands to ensure functionality. Of course, you could allow a developer
 to queue up a manual job as a debugger, but that should not be the default
 operating procedure.

### Scheduled and Triggered Actions

The events which cause a CI process to run should be both time based
and developer action based. Having both of these events helps reduce
errors introduced by developers of your code, and by developers of
external code

There should be an interval of time which
passes that causes an automatic CI process to run on the code base, e.g.
every night. This ensures that your codebase still works against
external dependencies which may have published changes. Lets take an
example of some Python based code which depends on `numpy`. If the
developers push a `numpy` build overnight which changes one of the functions
that your code relies on, it can cause your code to unexpectedly fail.
If you did not have the timed build, there is a chance that this bug
would not have been caught until after your new feature was developed,
forcing you to go back and redo your work, after you figured out what
the new bug was.

Developer actions should automatically trigger a CI process to run.
When a developer wants to add new code, that code should be verified
that it will not break anything. This severs not only as a means of bug
checking, but also validation that all components of a code continue to
work well with each other. Consider the following example of upgrading a
codebase from Python 2 to Python 3 comparability. Beyond syntax changes,
there could be much older code in the code base which may unexpectedly
break. Even beyond the codebase's functionality, the deployment of your
code on your platform may no longer work due to the upgrade. If you did
not run CI, you may not detect this until you think you are ready to
deploy.

### Visible Status to All Developers

CI process are not meant to be hidden actions or secreative black boxes.
Developers should know when CI is running so they can see if their
proposed code is being tested. Similarly, other developers will want
to see if someone is proposing new code that is being tested.

### Visible Results to All Developers

All developers should see the results of CI processes. This not only
helps ensure that new code will likely be good to merge, but it also
helps in the debugging process when it does not.

### Logged Outputs

CI process logs should be stored for a length of time. Having a record of
past CI runs allows comparison between different instances to debug any
issues that may arise. It is not required to keep the logs forever,
but long enough that they can developers can use them if need be.

### Isolated Build and Testing Environments

CI process should be entirely isolated from your production environment.
This ensures that tests and debugging are not accidentally pushed to
live environments. CI runs can be very frequent and resource intensive
based on the number of developers and how many tests CI runs. CI
processes should be run on separate resources than your live
environment to avoid resource drains.

## GitHub CI Tools for You and Your Code

Here we cover some CI options which can be integrate right now into your
GitHub code! This is by no means an exhaustive list, but GitHub keeps
a handy page programs which can be integrated [here](https://github.com/integrations).

By no means do you need all of these tools on every project. You should
consider your individual needs and choose the set of CI tools that
work for you.

### Travis

[Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) is a platform designed for
instant integration to GitHub. You simply add a `.travis.yml` file
in the root of a repository you have admin access to, then go to your
Travis account and enable Travis on that repository. There are some
[GitHub side setup](https://github.com/integrations/travis-ci) to enable
Travis on your projects, but its very strait forward.

Travis primarily works for Unix based testing and triggers its runs
any time a PR is created **or** updated. There are also settings
to build on pushes, and everything is controlled through very simple
options on your Travis settings.

Travis will automatically report itself in any PR on GitHub once enabled
and you can even restrict the ability to merge a PR if Travis does not
pass.

Logs of builds are kept for an extended length of time on Travis which
can be compared and debugged by anyone (although only admins have
access to manage the builds).

### AppVeyor

[AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) is a platform very similar to Travis, but it instead works for
Windows builds. If you want your code to run on Windows, we highly
recommend using this program.

Integration is avalable through the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/integrations/appveyor)

### CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is a CI platform with a few extra
features. These features include testing and deployment on mobile platforms (Android
and iOS), they can automatically round up build artifacts (extra files
created during build), and automatic dependency resolution to name a few.


## Examples to Help Get Started

Here we provide some references to existing, example CI files and
integration that you can copy to help you get started on your own CI.
These are actual CI scripts that are used in production software.

One thing to note is that beyond simply "Fetch Code", none of the CI
platforms in these examples **do** anything unless told to. In general,
these examples all fetch the code, and run some tests which, on fail,
generate an error that can cause the CI process to be considered a
failure (as expected behavior).

CI is not limited to one language!

### Example: Travis CI Compiles and Tests Your Code:


[YANK's Travis-ci file](https://github.com/choderalab/yank/blob/master/.travis.yml)
does several things:

1. Pulls the code base down (automatic from Travis, for pull requests its automatically gets the proposed code)
1. Installs a local copy of the code and all its dependencies
1. Runs the package's tests
    * If these tests fail, the CI process fails, which is the intended behavior
1. Runs the identical process on three versions of Python
1. Envokes a script after success to do some user-defined action.

This is a rather simple example one could do. The few Python functions
such as `conda` and `pip` are **not** a requirement of the CI platform, but
the project its applied to.


Another similar example is the [Omnia MD Conda Builder](https://github.com/omnia-md/conda-recipes/blob/master/.travis.yml)
which tells Travis to create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image,
run the image (which pulls and compiles the code). Its the same basic
process, but through a Docker image instead.


### Example: AppVeyor build and install scripts.

[MDTraj's AppVeyor file](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj/blob/master/appveyor.yml)
is a very simple file to set up, which in turn invokes a project-specific
file to actually run the tests.

This file is a good example of the "bare bones" type of scripts you need
to actually start CI. It simply sets up two architectures, installs
some basic Python needs, then runs a script specific to the repository.
AppVeyor (like many other CI's) is designed to read a failure in a
script as a failure in the whole CI process, so you don't have to worry
about witting script which pass a fail state explicitly to AppVeyor.



## Tips for Getting Started with Your CI

1. Start from a working build script from another repository
    * Modify as needed.
1. Start with a free option
    * Many CI platforms, especially those with GitHub Integration are free for a small number of repositories
    * Try different ones out, see what works for you and your code
1. Start experimenting with CI and settings
    * Don't be afraid to break something in the CI script, all the suggestions here are isolated environments that are spun up and shut down on demand
    * **Disclaimer**: Scripts you write which actually push to or interact with a live server no mater where its run from will still work. Its up to your judgement if you want those as part of your CI platform.
1. Start reading the docs for your CI platform
    * The examples here don't even begin to scratch the surface of all the settings you could use.
    * Remember that you don't necessarily need all these options to make a good CI environments
1. Start writing tests for CI to run!
    * CI alone cannot fully test your code, its up to you to write the tests CI will run to ensure everything works
1. Start now!
    * CI will save you, and anyone else working on your code so much time, you will wonder why you did not start sooner
    * Given many CI options are free, how easy it is to set up with GitHub Integration, and how low-risk it is, there is no reason to not try CI at the very least!
